# CineCompare üé•üçø

CineCompare (deployed at [vercel](https://movie-comparator.vercel.app/)) is an interactive app that lets you visually compare movie information using dynamic SVG visualizations. Dive into movie comparisons and explore key metrics.

## Architecture

**1. Folder Structure**

```shell
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api # Api functions.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components # Abstraction of reusable components.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config # Application and Third-party configurations, environment variables, for instance.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data # Data layer (currently using TanStack query).
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specs # E2E tests.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures # Mocked API responses.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page-object-models # Abstractions of pages.
```

**2. Third-Party Abstractions**

Interaction and integration with third parties are abstracted under the data and API layers, such that only the functions inside `src/api` are aware of the implementation details. The rest of the application uses the data layer, which is agnostic.

**3. Colocated Files**

Colocated Files organize related components, utils, and tests together to improve maintainability, discoverability, and encapsulation.

**4. Data Management**

The application's data is pretty simple at this point, so I opted to keep its state in the App component. Should the application grow in complexity, I would use a better data management strategy, such as a React context or even a dedicated library like Redux. Also, I chose to persist the state in the URL so it's easily shareable.

In addition, I'm also relying on TanStack queries caching and expiration capabilities to ensure data does not go stale and is efficiently cached.

## Technical Choices

- React
- Typescript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- TanStack Query
- Jest
- Playwright
- GitHub actions
- Vercel

**1. React + Vite + Typescript**

Vite significantly accelerates development with its fast server start-up and HMR, requiring minimal configuration, making it a good choice.

Typescript adds type safety, which helps catch errors more effectively and write more maintainable code.

**2. TailwindCSS for styling**

TailwindCSS is easy to use and speeds up some UI prototyping. Its ready-to-use design pieces mean less time writing custom code.

**3. Vitest for unit testing**

Vitest has fast test execution and seamless integration with Vite, which reduces potential maintenance effort.

**4. Playwright for end-to-end testing**

Playwright was chosen because it supports multiple browsers, offers powerful features like auto-waiting, and provides robust APIs for simulating user interactions. It's fast and reliable and enables cross-browser testing with a single codebase.

**5. GitHub actions and Vercel for CI/CD**

Vercel provides nice features to use out of the box, such as deploying and inspecting the application.

GitHub actions easily integrate with the GitHub repo and are also very used to configure.

## TODOs

This section lists possible improvements and features.

- [ ] Improve the UX for larger datasets.
  - [ ] Improve loading states.
  - [ ] Improve error handling.
- [ ] Implement more unit and e2e tests following the production readiness checklist above.
- [ ] Architecture improvements.
  - [ ] Implement a backend API to abstract the integration with the movies API away from the front end.
- [ ] Identify and address potential edge cases
  - [ ] Show meaningful error messages.
  - [ ] Implement 404/403 error messages.
  - [ ] Find the performance limitation; for example, if the number of compared movies is super large, we might end up with thousands of SVG elements on the page, which causes some performance issues, and we need to switch to Canvas at that point.
  - [ ] Mobile devices:
    - [ ] Ensure the application works on multiple devices and browsers by following the production readiness checklist above.
- [ ] UX improvements
  - [ ] Add additional filters (e.g., filter by year, genre, and director).
  - [ ] Introduce a movie details page feature, enabling users to look into more details.
- [ ] Use i18n to localize content.
- [ ] Security audity.
  - [ ] Improve security as a whole.
